# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The Pyber president has given a new assignment. Using Python and Pandas, to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, or Rural). Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Total Rides:
The total number of rides in each city type is as follows:

Urban had higher ride than the other areas.
Total Drivers:
The total number of drivers working in each city type is as follows:

Fares from City Types:
The total amount of fares collected for each city type is as follows:
 
Average Fare:
The average fare per ride for each city type is as follows:
 

Average Fare per Driver:
The average fare per driver for each city type is as follows:




Data Summary:
after cleaning up the dataframe, the result looks as follows:

 

Weekly Summary:
Differences between Urban, suburban, and rural fares.  The urban type generates twice the suburban city type, and the suburban types generates around four times (!) the rural city type. There is significant disparity between the three city types as illustrated below:


Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
