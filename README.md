# PyBer_Analysis
  # Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
  

  The Pyber president has given a new assignment. Using Python and Pandas, to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, or Rural). Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Data Summary:
after cleaning up the dataframe, the result looks as follows:

Weekly Summary:


Differences between Urban, suburban, and rural fares. Urban areas consistently show higher total fare amounts when compared to Suburban and Rural areas. The Y-axis represents Total Fares ($USD) while the X-axis represents each month data was analyzed. There is significant disparity between the three city types as illustrated below:

  ##Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
  


 Based on the analysis, it is very clear that the most revenue is generated in Urban areas.Urban city have more population and people like taking rides instead of driving.  All three areas had higher fare in end of feb. This could be changed in weather.
